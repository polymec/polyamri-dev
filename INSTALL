------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building polyamri requires CMake 2.8.5, found at http://www.cmake.org/, as
well as GNU make. It also requires you to have polymec 
(http://github.com/polymec/polymec-dev) built and installed somewhere. To 
build polyamri on a UNIX-like system, use the following commands:

     $ make config polymec=/path/to/polymec
     $ make

Installation
------------
To install polyamri, run

    $ make install

The default installation prefix is /usr/local. To pick an installation 
prefix for polyamri pass prefix=[path] to make config. For example,

    $ make config prefix=~/myroot/

will cause polyamri to be installed in ~/myroot/ when make install is run.

Other make commands
-------------------
   $ make uninstall 
          Removes all files installed by 'make install'.
   
   $ make clean 
          Removes all object files but retains the configuration options.
   
   $ make distclean 
          Performs clean and completely removes the build directory.
